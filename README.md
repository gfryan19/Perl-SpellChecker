MacOS is our preferred platform.
There is no language compiler for Perl because it is an interpreted language. Download any text editor that you like using and that works with Perl. A popular one for Perl is Padre, but we used Sublime Text 2. 
https://www.sublimetext.com
http://padre.perlide.org

Now, you must verify that you have perl installed, type into your terminal window the command: la$ which perl

Next you need to install Xcode so that you will be able to install and use CPAN.
http://www.cpan.org/ports/binaries.html#mac_osx
Click on Mac App Store link to the url:
https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
Click on View in Mac App Store under the hammer.
Click get (type your itunes/appleID password)
Click on Open under the hammer (to accept the license)
Click agree. This will require you to enter your mac’s admin password.
Xcode launches. Quit Xcode.

Now you need to download CPAN
Do once in terminal: cpan App::cpanminus
There will be lots of output, then
“Would you like to configure as much as possible automatically? [yes]”
hit return to accept the default
then there is more output
“What approach do you want? (Choose ‘local::lib’, ‘sudo’ or ‘manual’)[local::lib]”
sudo
“Would you like me to automatically choose some CPAN mirror sites for you? (This means connecting to the Internet) [yes]”
hit return to accept the deafault
Then you might get a popup window asking if you would like to install the developer tools for the make command
If this pops up, click install and agree to the license
Click done to continue
There will be a lot more output, it will say it’s installing a bunch of things such as libraries
The last line should say “install —- OK” at the end, then you know it worked.

Now you need to download the appropriate module Tree::Ternary_XS
type in the terminal: cpanm Tree::Ternary_XS

make sure the pathways in your code are correct
You want to make sure that the module is in the perl5 lib folder
A correct example of a pathway might look like:
Users/la/perl5/lib/perl5

Modify the perl program to add the path:
use lib ‘/Users/la/perl5/lib/perl5’;

Now try running the perl program:
perl spellChecker.pl
